The objective of this project is to analysis Classification (or clustering) and Finding rules by using Apriori and describe classification using Decision tree, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM. We have shown some comparison between those classification and reach on a result to choose which parts or take the best accuracy model as shown.  Dataset :  The dataset used in this study is from Kaggle. The dataset has 11 attributes and 400 rows. Each row corresponds to one particular Customer and each attribute corresponds to the observations or type of each patient.   Apriori:  Apriori uses a "bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation, and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The apriori principle can reduce the number of item sets we need to examine. Put simply, the apriori principle states that if an item set is infrequent, then all its subsets must also be infrequent.
